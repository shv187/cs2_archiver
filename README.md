# CS2 Archiver
It's a small tool I wrote to backup CS2 files easly.

# Description
It creates the following structure:
```
.
├── binaries
│   ├── <patch_version> 
│      ├── client
│         ├── <files>
│      ├── engine
│         ├── <files>
└──
```

# Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/shv187/cs2_archiver.git
```
```
cd cs2_archiver
```
```
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
```
```
<run the executable>
```
